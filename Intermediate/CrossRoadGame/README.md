# Cross Road Game

This project is Day 23 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.

This project uses Turtle Graphics to recreate the classic Frogger game but with a turtle instead of a frog

Users can use the 'up' arrow key to move the turtle up

Each time the turtle makes it to the top of the screen, the difficulty gets harder
