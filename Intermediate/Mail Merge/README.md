This project is to help understand the file opening, closing with
its mode, "r", "w" where r stands for read and w stands for write. Mail Merge
replaces the "[name]" placeholder to the name of the guests. 

Reading the file requires twice due to reading on the letter and guest name,
writting the file requires once as it actually writes the letter with each individual guest name.
