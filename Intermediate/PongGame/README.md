# Pong Game

This project is Day 22 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.

This project uses Turtle Graphics to recreate the classic pong game from 1972

Users can use the 'up' and 'down' arrow keys to control the right paddle 
and use 'w' and 's' to control the left paddle
